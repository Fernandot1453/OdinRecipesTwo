    <p>A nice creamy Lasagna consisting of creamy ricotta, savory meat sauce, and lots of cheese</p> <!--Description Box-->
    <li>
        <ul>Ricotta Cheese - 2 cups</ul>
        <ul>1 Large Egg</ul>
        <ul>Mozarella CHeese - 2 cups</ul>
        <ul>Parmesan CHeese - 3/4 cup</ul>
        <ul>2 teaspoons Italian Seasoning</ul>
        <ul>1/2 teaspoon of salt and pepper</ul>
    </li> <!--Ingredients-->

    <ol>
        <li>Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.</l1>
    </ol> <!--Steps-->
